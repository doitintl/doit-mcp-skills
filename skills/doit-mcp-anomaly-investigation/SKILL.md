name: doit-mcp-anomaly-investigation
description: Use this skill ALWAYS when the user asks about cost anomalies, spending spikes, unexpected charges, or suspicious costs. Triggers on requests like "show anomalies", "why did my costs spike", "investigate this charge", "what happened to my spending", "unusual costs", "cost alert", or any anomaly analysis. This skill MUST be used before calling any DoiT anomaly MCP tools directly.

# DoiT MCP Anomaly Investigation

Start from DoiT anomaly context, then branch into AWS or GCP inspection. Keep every follow-up call read-only and tightly scoped.

## Tool Selection

Before starting, check if the DCI CLI is installed by running `command -v dci`.

- **If `dci` is available**: use CLI commands as the primary tool. They are listed in the DCI CLI Command Mapping section below.
- **If `dci` is not available**: you MUST ask the user if they want to install it before proceeding. Tell them: "The DCI CLI is not installed. It's the recommended way to interact with DoiT. Would you like to install it?". Wait for the user's response. If the user agrees, invoke the `doit-mcp-setup` skill to install and authenticate the DCI CLI, then resume this workflow. Only fall back to MCP tools if the user explicitly declines.

Do not mix CLI and MCP calls within the same workflow — pick one and stay consistent.

### DCI CLI Command Mapping

| Operation | DCI CLI Command | MCP Tool (fallback) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| List anomalies | `dci get-anomalies --output json` | `get_anomalies` |
| Get specific anomaly | `dci get-anomaly id:<anomaly-id> --output json` | `get_anomaly` |
| Validate session | `dci status` | `validate_user` |

Use `--output json` when you need to parse anomaly fields programmatically. After extracting anomaly context, cloud-specific follow-up (GCP/AWS MCP) remains unchanged regardless of CLI or MCP choice.

## Reference Files

Read these as needed during investigation:

- `references/anomaly-fields.md` — field definitions, platform values, severity levels, feedback reasons. Read this when you need to interpret anomaly response fields or decide what to extract before cloud follow-up.
- `references/service-abbreviations.md` — mapping between DoiT display names and cloud-native service names. Read this when a service name filter does not match in cloud MCP tools.
- `references/common-patterns.md` — common root causes by service and anomaly type. Read this to form initial hypotheses faster, but always confirm with evidence.

## Investigation Order

Use this order unless the user already supplied a specific anomaly payload:

1. `get_anomalies` or `get_anomaly` on DoiT MCP
2. Extract platform, account/project, time window, service, SKU, and `topSkus` details
3. Choose the cloud path from the `platform` field
4. Run cloud-specific MCP follow-up
5. Summarize root cause, evidence, and next actions

If the request is only about SKU mapping in the codebase, use the repo SKU-mapping skills instead of this skill.

## DoiT MCP First Pass

- Use `get_anomalies` when the user asks for recent or top anomalies.
- Use `get_anomaly` when the anomaly ID is already known.
- Extract the cloud, account or project, time window, service, and any SKU-like labels before touching AWS or GCP MCP.
- Check `topSkus` for `resourceId` and `operation` — these are the best narrowing fields for cloud follow-up.
- If DoiT MCP already answers the question, stop there.

## GCP Path

The GCP MCP in this repo exposes two stable tools:

1. `check_gcp_access_permission`
2. `gcp_account_access`

Always call `check_gcp_access_permission` before `gcp_account_access`.

### GCP Workflow

1. Call `check_gcp_access_permission` with the target `projectId` and `customerId`.
2. If access is not ready, stop and report the required action.
3. If access is ready, call `gcp_account_access` with a small read-only program.
4. Break multi-step investigations into multiple `gcp_account_access` calls instead of one broad script.

### GCP Script Rules

- Use only `@google-cloud/*` SDKs.
- Return the minimum serializable data needed to answer the question.
- Keep each script focused on one hypothesis.
- Prefer narrowing by project, service, resource name, and time window from the anomaly.
- If the first script reveals a likely resource family, run a second script against that family instead of expanding scope.

### GCP Anomaly Sequence

Use this progression for SKU or service anomalies:

1. Confirm the affected project and service from DoiT MCP.
2. Check access with `check_gcp_access_permission`.
3. Use `gcp_account_access` to inspect the smallest relevant inventory or config surface.
4. Use another `gcp_account_access` call for logs, metrics, or policy details only if the first pass leaves a live hypothesis.

## AWS Path

The AWS service in this repo is a proxy around `awslabs.core-mcp-server`, so do not assume fixed tool names beyond standard MCP discovery.

### AWS Workflow

1. Initialize the AWS MCP session for the correct customer context.
2. Call `tools/list`.
3. Select the smallest read-only billing, cost, logging, or resource inspection tools that match the anomaly.
4. Run billing and usage context first, then resource or event inspection second.
5. If the AWS MCP tool list does not expose a needed capability, say so instead of inventing a tool.

### AWS Priorities

- Prefer cost or billing evidence before deep resource inspection.
- Use CloudTrail, CloudWatch, or service-specific inspection only after the cost spike has been localized.
- Keep calls narrow by account, region, service, and time range.

## Output Rules

- Tie every conclusion back to evidence from DoiT MCP or the cloud MCP.
- Separate confirmed cause, likely cause, and unresolved questions.
- Recommend next actions only after identifying the cost driver.
- If a missing permission blocked the investigation, state that clearly and stop.
- Include the anomaly ID, platform, service, time window, and cost impact in every summary.

## Gotchas

- **Service name mismatch**: DoiT anomalies use abbreviated names (e.g., "Amazon EC2") while cloud APIs use full names (e.g., "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud"). Check `references/service-abbreviations.md` before filtering.
- **Platform field is the routing key**: Always use the `platform` field to decide GCP vs AWS path — do not infer from `serviceName` alone, as some service names are ambiguous.
- **topSkus may be empty**: Not all anomalies have SKU-level breakdown. When `topSkus` is empty, fall back to service-level investigation.
- **Sensitivity affects what you see**: Anomalies are filtered by customer sensitivity settings (-1/0/1). A "no anomalies found" result may mean the threshold is set high, not that nothing happened.
- **Azure, Snowflake, Datadog, Databricks, OpenAI anomalies exist**: DoiT detects anomalies for these platforms too, but there are no cloud MCP follow-up tools for them yet. Report the DoiT MCP findings and stop — do not attempt cloud-level inspection.
- **GCP access check is mandatory**: Skipping `check_gcp_access_permission` and going straight to `gcp_account_access` will fail. Always check first.
- **AWS tool names are dynamic**: The AWS MCP proxy wraps `awslabs.core-mcp-server` — tool names may change between sessions. Always call `tools/list` first.
- **Read-only only**: Never run mutating operations through cloud MCP during investigation. All follow-up must be read-only.
- **Feedback on past anomalies**: If `customerFeedback` exists on similar anomalies, check the `reason` field — repeated `FAULTY_ANOMALY_DETECTION_MODEL` feedback means this service may produce false positives for this customer.
